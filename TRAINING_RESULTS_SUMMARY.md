     - Different market regimes training
     - Longer holding periods to reduce costs

4. **Transaction Cost Management**
   - Current 3.2% daily turnover is high
   - Reduce to <2% by:

   - Include options data (put/call ratios)
   - Add alternative data sources

3. **Ensemble Approaches**
   - Combine PPO with SAC and A2C
   - Weighted voting based on market regime
   - Reduce model-specific overfitting

4. **Hyperparameter Optimization**

## üìö What We Learned

### Reinforcement Learning Concepts Applied
1. **State-Action-Reward Framework**
   - State: Market prices + indicators + holdings + cash
   - Action: Portfolio weight allocation (continuous)
   - Reward: Sharpe ratio - transaction costs

2. **PPO Algorithm Mechanics**
   - Policy gradient with clipped objective
   - Prevents large policy updates
   - Stable learning (explained_variance: 89.3%)

3. **Multi-Asset Portfolio Optimization**
   - Learning correlation patterns
   - Sector rotation strategies
   - Risk budgeting across positions

### Key Insights
1. **Bull markets favor passive strategies**
   - 2023-2024 was strong bull market
   - Buy-and-hold outperformed active RL
   - Consider market regime detection

2. **Transaction costs matter**
   - 3.2% daily turnover is expensive
   - Even 0.1% costs reduce returns by ~2%
   - Holding period optimization needed

3. **Risk-adjusted returns > absolute returns**
   - 17% with Sharpe 0.5 < 15% with Sharpe 1.5
   - Drawdowns destroy compounding
   - Focus on consistency over peak returns

4. **Model generalization**
   - 89.3% explained variance = strong learning
   - But test period underperformance suggests overfitting
   - Need more diverse training scenarios
