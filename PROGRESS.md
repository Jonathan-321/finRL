## 🐛 Known Issues & Challenges

### Data Quality
- **Issue:** Some tickers fail to download from Yahoo Finance
- **Impact:** Reduces universe size
- **Solution:** Implement retry logic, use alternative sources

### Training Time
- **Issue:** Local training is slow for large portfolios
- **Impact:** Limits experimentation speed
- **Solution:** Use Modal with GPU acceleration

### Model Overfitting
- **Issue:** Models may overfit to training period
- **Impact:** Poor out-of-sample performance
- **Solution:** Longer training periods, regularization, walk-forward testing

### Transaction Costs
- **Issue:** High-frequency rebalancing increases costs
- **Impact:** Erodes returns
- **Solution:** Minimum trade thresholds, rebalancing constraints

## 📝 Notes & Learnings

### Key Learnings
1. **Data quality is critical** - Spend time on preprocessing
2. **Start small, scale gradually** - Test locally before cloud
3. **Transaction costs matter** - Can make or break a strategy
4. **Risk management is essential** - Returns without risk adjustment are meaningless
5. **Ensemble methods work** - Diversification across algorithms helps

### Interesting Findings
- Tech stocks show strong momentum patterns
- Financial stocks correlate highly with macro indicators
- Crypto shows different regime characteristics
- Transaction costs significantly impact high-turnover strategies

### Future Research Ideas
- Incorporate options data for volatility forecasting
- Use transformer models for time-series prediction
- Multi-time-frame analysis (daily + intraday)
- Market regime detection
- Adversarial training for robustness
