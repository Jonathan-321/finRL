### Why This Architecture?

1. **Small is Fast** - Need <10ms inference for real-time trading
2. **MLP is Sufficient** - Price patterns don't need conv nets or transformers
3. **PPO is Stable** - More stable than Q-learning for continuous actions
4. **Actor-Critic** - Policy network (actor) + value estimator (critic) for efficient learning

## 🔢 Mathematical Formulation

### State Space (Input)

**Dimension:** 803 features

```python
State = [
    # 1. Raw Prices (50 features)
    close_price_stock1,
    close_price_stock2,
    ...,
    close_price_stock50,

    # 2. Technical Indicators (650 features = 50 stocks × 13 indicators)
    macd_stock1,       # Moving Average Convergence Divergence
    rsi_stock1,        # Relative Strength Index (14-period)
    cci_stock1,        # Commodity Channel Index (20-period)
    dx_stock1,         # Directional Index (14-period)
    sma20_stock1,      # Simple Moving Average (20-day)
    sma50_stock1,      # Simple Moving Average (50-day)
    sma200_stock1,     # Simple Moving Average (200-day)
    bb_upper_stock1,   # Bollinger Band Upper
    bb_middle_stock1,  # Bollinger Band Middle
    bb_lower_stock1,   # Bollinger Band Lower
    atr_stock1,        # Average True Range (14-period)
    williams_r_stock1, # Williams %R (14-period)
    stoch_stock1,      # Stochastic Oscillator (14-period)
    ...,               # Repeat for all 50 stocks

    # 3. Portfolio State (2 features)
    cash_balance,      # Available cash for trading
    portfolio_value,   # Total portfolio value

    # 4. Holdings (50 features)
    shares_held_stock1,
    shares_held_stock2,
    ...,
    shares_held_stock50,

    # 5. Time Features (1 feature)
    day_of_week        # 0-4 (Monday to Friday)
]
```

**Total:** 50 + 650 + 2 + 50 + 1 = **803 dimensions**

### Action Space (Output)

**Dimension:** 50 continuous values in [-1, +1]

```python
Action = [
    action_stock1,  # -1.0 (sell all) to +1.0 (buy max)
    action_stock2,
    ...,
    action_stock50
]

# Interpretation:
action = -1.0  →  Sell 100% of holdings
action = -0.5  →  Sell 50% of holdings
action =  0.0  →  Hold current position
action = +0.5  →  Buy 50 shares (50% of hmax)
action = +1.0  →  Buy 100 shares (hmax = max position)
```

### Reward Function

```python
# Primary reward: Portfolio value change
reward = (portfolio_value_t - portfolio_value_t-1) * scaling_factor

where:
  scaling_factor = 1e-4  # Normalize rewards to [-1, +1] range

# Transaction cost penalty
transaction_cost = Σ |trade_value_i| * cost_rate
cost_rate = 0.001  # 0.1% per trade

# Total reward
total_reward = reward - transaction_cost

# Example:
# If portfolio goes from $1,000,000 to $1,005,000 (+$5,000)
# reward = 5000 * 1e-4 = 0.5
# If transaction costs = $100
# total_reward = 0.5 - 0.0001 = 0.4999
```

## 🧠 Neural Network Architecture

### Policy Network (Actor)

```python
PolicyNetwork(
  (features_extractor): FlattenExtractor()  # No processing needed

  (mlp_extractor): MlpExtractor(
    (policy_net): Sequential(
      (0): Linear(in_features=803, out_features=64, bias=True)   # ~51K params
      (1): ReLU()
      (2): Linear(in_features=64, out_features=64, bias=True)    # ~4K params
      (3): ReLU()
    )

    (value_net): Sequential(
      (0): Linear(in_features=803, out_features=64, bias=True)   # ~51K params
      (1): ReLU()
      (2): Linear(in_features=64, out_features=64, bias=True)    # ~4K params
      (3): ReLU()
    )
  )

  (action_net): Linear(in_features=64, out_features=50, bias=True)  # ~3K params
  (value_net): Linear(in_features=64, out_features=1, bias=True)    # ~65 params
)

Total Parameters: ~50,000 - 100,000
Memory Footprint: ~400 KB
```

### Parameter Count Breakdown

```
Layer 1 (Policy):  803 inputs × 64 neurons + 64 biases = 51,456 params
Layer 2 (Policy):  64 × 64 + 64 biases = 4,160 params
Output (Policy):   64 × 50 + 50 biases = 3,250 params

Layer 1 (Value):   803 × 64 + 64 = 51,456 params
Layer 2 (Value):   64 × 64 + 64 = 4,160 params
Output (Value):    64 × 1 + 1 = 65 params

Total: ~114,547 parameters
```

### Activation Functions

- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):** Used in hidden layers
  ```
  f(x) = max(0, x)
  ```
  - Why? Fast computation, no vanishing gradients, sparse activation

- **Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent):** Used in output layer
  ```
  f(x) = (e^x - e^-x) / (e^x + e^-x)
  ```
  - Why? Outputs in [-1, +1] range match our action space

## 🎓 PPO Algorithm Explained

### What is PPO?

**Proximal Policy Optimization** - A reinforcement learning algorithm that:
1. Learns a policy (strategy) for taking actions
2. Uses past experience to improve gradually
3. Prevents drastic policy changes (stability)

### Key Components

#### 1. Policy (π)
```
π(a|s) = Probability of taking action 'a' in state 's'
```
The neural network learns this probability distribution.

#### 2. Value Function (V)
```
V(s) = Expected future reward starting from state 's'
```
Helps evaluate if a state is good or bad.

#### 3. Advantage Function (A)
```
A(s, a) = Q(s, a) - V(s)
```
How much better is action 'a' compared to average?

#### 4. Clipped Objective
```python
L^CLIP(θ) = E[min(r_t(θ) * A_t, clip(r_t(θ), 1-ε, 1+ε) * A_t)]

where:
  r_t(θ) = π_θ(a_t|s_t) / π_θ_old(a_t|s_t)  # Probability ratio
  ε = 0.2  # Clip range
```

This prevents the policy from changing too much at once.

### Training Loop

```python
for iteration in range(500_000 timesteps):
    # 1. Collect experience
    for step in range(2048):  # n_steps
        state = env.get_state()
        action = policy.predict(state)
        next_state, reward = env.step(action)
        buffer.add(state, action, reward, next_state)

    # 2. Compute advantages
    advantages = compute_gae(buffer, gamma=0.99, lambda=0.95)

    # 3. Update policy (10 epochs on collected data)
    for epoch in range(10):
        for batch in buffer.get_batches(batch_size=64):
            # Compute policy loss
            ratio = new_policy_prob / old_policy_prob
            clipped_ratio = clip(ratio, 0.8, 1.2)
            policy_loss = -min(ratio * advantage, clipped_ratio * advantage)

            # Compute value loss
            value_loss = (predicted_value - actual_return)^2

            # Total loss
            loss = policy_loss + 0.5 * value_loss - 0.01 * entropy

            # Backpropagation
            optimizer.step(loss)
```

## 🔬 Model Interpretation

### What The Model Learned

Through 500,000 training steps, the model discovered:

1. **Momentum Patterns**
   - Stocks trending up → increase position
   - Stocks trending down → reduce position

2. **Mean Reversion**
   - Oversold (RSI < 30) → potential buy
   - Overbought (RSI > 70) → potential sell

3. **Risk Management**
   - High volatility (ATR) → reduce position sizes
   - Low volatility → increase positions

4. **Correlation Awareness**
   - Diversify across uncorrelated stocks
   - Avoid overconcentration in single sector

### What It DIDN'T Learn (Limitations)

1. **Fundamental Analysis** - No P/E ratios, earnings, etc.
2. **News Events** - Can't read news or understand catalysts
3. **Market Microstructure** - Doesn't model order books or liquidity
4. **Regime Changes** - Struggles in unprecedented market conditions

## 💬 Explaining To Different Audiences

### For Machine Learning Engineers

**"It's a standard PPO implementation from Stable-Baselines3 with a 2-layer MLP policy network. Input is a 803-dimensional state vector (prices + technical indicators + portfolio state), output is 50 continuous actions in [-1,+1] representing portfolio weights. We train on 4 years of daily OHLCV data with transaction cost penalties in the reward. Architecture is intentionally simple (50K params) for fast inference."**

### For Quantitative Traders

**"We use reinforcement learning to learn a trading policy that maps market state (prices, technical indicators, positions) to portfolio allocation decisions. Think of it as an adaptive technical analysis system that learns optimal indicator combinations and thresholds from historical data. The model trains by simulating thousands of trading scenarios and learning from P&L outcomes."**

### For Portfolio Managers

**"This AI system learns trading strategies from historical data, similar to how a junior trader learns from experience. It observes market conditions (prices, momentum, volatility) and decides how to allocate capital across 50 stocks. Unlike rule-based systems, it discovers patterns automatically and adapts its strategy based on what historically worked."**

### For Business Executives

**"We're using modern AI (specifically, reinforcement learning - the technology behind AlphaGo) to automate stock trading decisions. The system studies 4 years of market history, learns what works, and applies those lessons to make real-time trading decisions. It's like having a trader who never sleeps and learns from millions of simulated trades."**
